### CCET-IA-2
This project is created to demonstrate the uses of various services delivery models with the help of a simple application.

# Notes On Cloud 
Notes on cloud is a simple, cloud-based web application for creating, highlighting and deleting notes for various purposes. Users can create an account by registering on the website and start using its services. Returning users can log in to their accounts and make changes to the notes according to their requirements.

The two service delivery models used in our project are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).
